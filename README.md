## Project Overview
The focus of this multidisciplinary project is developing a section of the Mass Transit System, specifically a suspended monorail network, also known as the Blade Runner System. Our team is responsible for developing the **Carriage Control Program (CCP)** for two carriages.

## Carriage Control Program (CCP)
The Carriage Control Program will send and receive signals from the Central Control System or Master Control Program. Signals include the acceleration, deceleration, and stopping of carriages, with all states being conveyed by the color of onboard LEDs. The **TCP/IP protocol** will be used as the method of communication.
